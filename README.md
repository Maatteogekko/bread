### crackhead password manager
---
poorly written fancy python script to manage a .csv

based on the idea of using hashes of `<website>+<passphrase>` as your passwords
if you need to encrypt pre-set credentials, or store whatever data, it can also do aes256 encryption, same logic

edit the .csv if need arises idk, bye
